#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently on a fixed-term contract as an ML Researcher at [Motorway](https://motorway.co.uk/). I am working with scalable Bayesian machine learning models to obtain reliable vehicle price estimates for potential sellers when they first interact with the Motorway website. I am a _researcher_ in the sense that the work I am doing is exploratory for the company---I am not engaging in academic research here.

In November I will join [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) and the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) as a PhD student in [Vincent Fortuin](https://fortuin.github.io/)'s research group, the [ELPIS lab](https://fortuinlab.github.io/), where I will be working on Bayesian deep learning and other exciting topics!

Previously, I studied engineering at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) where my specialism was _computer and information engineering_, though my module choice made the MEng (final) year indistinguishable from a typical masters in Machine Learning, albeit with a [heavy dose of Bayesianism](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-1.html).
