  #        <p style="font-size: 16px;">When making decisions or predictions, we as humans rely on a sense of how confident we are in a belief before acting upon it. This is something we have evolved to do since we live in a constantly changing and uncertain world, and learning to <i>reason in the presence of uncertainty</i> is the only hope that we ever had for making sense of it all. Despite the many impressive advances in machine learning and artifical intelligence in recent times, reasoning sensibly in the presence of uncertainty is something that machines generally <i>cannot</i> do, and I would argue that it is a critical flaw; how can we trust machine intelligence if the machine believes it's never wrong?</p>

  #        <p style="font-size: 16px;">In my research I hope to develop powerful machine learning models that <i>do</i> have a sense of how certain they are, so that, once equipped with the ability to quantify their uncertainty, we can use machines to obtain more <i>reliable</i> predictions that can help us in arbitrarily high-stakes situations. The Bayesian formalism offers a highly principled approach to uncertainty quantification and it comes with many attractive benefits: the ability to specify prior beliefs and udpate them with data, the ability to automatically choose the "right" model out of many, the ability to update a trained model when new data becomes available, and so on. As such, a key part of my ethos is <i>to be Bayesian</i>, and I believe that Bayesian machine learning research is a good place to focus our efforts.</p>
